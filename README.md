## Script to Install the basics whenever I change my system (or anyone else)

---
### Notes before you begin:
    - This shell was made for Ubuntu/Debian based distros,
      make sure you have the right distro before you run;
    
    - You're gonna need root access to run this script;

### Tutorial: 
    Change your name in the file to the user you're logged into
        USERNAME: 'TEST'
        
    Make this file executable before run it with:
        sudo chmod u-x filename.sh
    
    execute it in the shell with:
        sudo su
        ./path/to/file/filename.sh
    
    To view results and logs:
        sudo su
        cd ~/.logs
        cat installation_log_success.txt 
            OR
        cat installation_log_error.txt

#### Note for myself: 
    - Are you changing your system again?
